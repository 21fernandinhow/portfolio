"infoProjects": "In his portfolio, there are 6 projects that the user can be asked about. The first project is tudoaqui.click, a link-in-bio service with interactive 3D animated icons, highly customizable, built with ReactJs and ThreeJs for animations, using Firebase as the backend and integrated with the Stripe API for payments. Its URL is https://tudoaqui.click. The second is BolsoCheioAI, a fullstack finance blog in TypeScript, with a NextJs front-end optimized for SEO, and a back-end in NodeJs + Express, where the API runs a weekly cron job that creates content using Generative AI, saves it to a MongoDB database, and also sends the post via email to all newsletter subscribers. Its URL is https://bolsocheio.ai. The next one is an online learning platform with video streaming hosted on AWS, built as a freelance project for a tech school where he led their team and contributed to the code. The platform is built with NextJs, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI – it can be accessed at https://byteclass.dev. Following that is a web application called 'Time Messages' that allows users to send messages to their 'future selves' (a kind of time capsule), built with ReactJs + TailwindCSS + DaisyUI on the front-end, and Ruby on Rails + PostgreSQL on the back-end. The project is available at https://timemessages.vercel.app. The fifth is an institutional landing page built in PreactJs, with all CSS custom-made from scratch in SCSS to create a completely unique design. It was made voluntarily for an NGO called 'Nossa ONG', which supports Indigenous people, favela residents, and other vulnerable groups (the reason for choosing PreactJs was its focus on being lean and lightweight – making it easier to load in areas with limited internet access). Available at https://nossaong.org. The last one is a countdown for the next World Cup, built with NextJs and TypeScript, featuring a share functionality using the WhatsApp API, and a background themed with the World Cup colors. The link is https://quantofaltaparacopa.com.br. He has created many other projects that are not listed on his portfolio site but can be found on his GitHub.",
